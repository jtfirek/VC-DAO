# The Electronic Capital VC DAO Project

### **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**
I used the buildspace x thirdweb tuturial DAO Toturial to create my own Venture Captial Firm powered by the Ethereum Blockchain.
Members our this DAO can contribute etheruem to the community treasurary in exchange for ECGT our organizations goverance token. 
(The tokens are currently free for test purposes) Members can then vote in invest in different companies using their ECGT. Our goverance contract will then automatically deploy the community's ethereum into investments.


### **How to Run**
1. Run `npm install` at the root of your directory
2. Run `npm start` to start the project


### **Technical Details**
âœ… deployed a custom ERC-20 token (ECGT).

âœ… deployed a ERC-1155 NFT people can mint to join the Venture Capital DAO.

âœ… deployed a governance contract + treasury to store the DAO's funding automate voting.

âœ… built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet (GoerliEth testnet), mint their Membership NFT for Electronic Capital, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members of the VC + actually vote on proposals like future investments that are executed directly by your governance contract.
